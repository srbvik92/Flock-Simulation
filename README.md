# Flock-Simulation
A flock simulation in C++. I did it as a part of homework project in the class of Introduction to Computer Graphics. It simulates realistic crowd movement, the flocks avoids collision to each other, and they also go towards the food. It uses kd-Tree file for finding nearest neighbour, whose copyright is owned by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
